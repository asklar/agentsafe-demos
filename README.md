# agentlab — a lab for agentic-security demos

**A reusable foundation for building small, recordable, open-source demos about
agent governance.** Every demo is middleware over one tiny tool-call
interception shim, so the second demo costs a fraction of the first and each one
becomes shareable content with a single capture command.

> Autonomous agents are only as safe as the tools they can reach. This lab makes
> that concrete: it puts a governable seam between an agent and its tools, and
> shows — side by side — what happens with and without it.

## Why this exists

Shipping one demo is easy; shipping a demo *every week that survives public
scrutiny* needs scaffolding. `agentlab` provides three things so the marginal
demo is cheap:

1. **A shared shim** ([`shim/`](./shim)) — the tool-call interception substrate
   every demo builds on. See [`shim/README.md`](./shim/README.md).
2. **A demo template** ([`demos/_template`](./demos/_template)) — drop-in
   scaffold with a runnable `demo.py`, `run.sh`, `SCRIPT.md`, and a smoke test.
3. **A capture pipeline** ([`capture/`](./capture)) — one command turns a demo
   into a text log / terminal recording / GIF.

## Quick start

```bash
# Run the reference demo (no dependencies beyond Python 3.10+)
./demos/00-hello-gate/run.sh

# Run the whole test suite (stdlib only)
python3 run_tests.py

# Scaffold a new demo
./new_demo.sh injection-tripwire "Injection Tripwire"

# Capture a demo as shareable content
capture/record.sh 00-hello-gate
```

## The shared shim in one screen

Each demo wires the same `Interceptor` with different middleware. A middleware
can veto a call before it runs (`before`) and/or observe it after (`after`):

```python
from shim import Interceptor, make_toolbox
from shim.middleware import PolicyGate, InjectionTripwire, FlightRecorder

ix = Interceptor(
    make_toolbox("/tmp/agent-workspace"),
    middleware=[PolicyGate(rules), InjectionTripwire(), FlightRecorder()],
)
ix.call("delete_file", path="production.db")   # -> Blocked, tool never runs
```

That's the whole idea: **the three roadmap concepts are three middleware, not
three frameworks.**

| Roadmap concept | Middleware | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A. Guardrail Proxy (policy gate) | `PolicyGate` | flagship demo (SKL-3) |
| B. Injection Tripwire (taint) | `InjectionTripwire` | [demo #2](./demos/01-injection-tripwire) (SKL-6) ✅ |
| C. Agent Flight Recorder (ledger) | `FlightRecorder` + `AuditSink` | demo #3 |

The reference demo [`demos/00-hello-gate`](./demos/00-hello-gate) composes all
three at once to prove the substrate generalizes;
[`demos/01-injection-tripwire`](./demos/01-injection-tripwire) is the focused
Concept B demo — it shows an allow/deny policy is *not enough* to stop a
prompt-injection exfil, and a taint tripwire is.

## Adding a demo

See [`HOWTO.md`](./HOWTO.md). The short version: `./new_demo.sh <slug>`, edit the
plan and middleware, run it, capture it.
